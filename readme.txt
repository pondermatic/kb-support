The ultimate help desk and knowledge base support tool plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

An effective Helpdesk / Support desk tool is one that encourages users to find and implement the solution to their queries without actually logging a support ticket and KB Support has been developed to do exactly that!

From the moment your customers begin to log a ticket, KB Support will search your knowledgebase and offer potential solutions based upon the articles that are published on your site.

From your own experience in running a helpdesk for your product(s) you will know that in a busy environment, documenting solutions and making them readily available to your customers always seems to take a back seat. KB Support makes this process much easier and encourages your support desk agents to produce articles when working through resolution of a customers ticket. Those articles are then immediately available on your website, and automatically referenced during a support ticket submission as a potential solution.

Key Features of KB Support include:

* Easily manage and customise submission forms. No coding required, multiple forms can be created and utilised
* Guest submission is fully supported. Customers do not need an account to create or manage support tickets.
* A fully responsive and clean front end design where customers can manage their tickets, including viewing and creating replies
* Integrated Knowledge Base Articles can be easily created and referenced to try and offer solutions without tickets being created
* Ability to restrict access to individual knowledge base articles to logged in users only
* Auto assign new tickets to agents based on current ticket count, or randomly
* Tracks an agents status so you can see if they are online or offline
* A number of useful shortcodes to display submission forms, KB Article lists, ticket history, login/registration forms, profile editor, KB Article search form - and more
* Private notes that are visible to agents only
* Restrict which tickets an agent can view. i.e. Just those to which they are assigned
* A bunch of hooks and filters for our developer friends
